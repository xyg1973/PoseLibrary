'''
Adjustment Blending is a method for adjusting additive layer interpolation between keyframes, so that movement on the layer is shifted to areas where there is already movement on the base layer.

This helps to maintain the existing energy of the base layer motion, and helps to maintain contact points. For more information, see this talk from GDC 2016: https://youtu.be/eeWBlMJHR14?t=518
